# API Reference

## Overview

RCAccelerator provides an AI-assisted chatbot interface for troubleshooting CI failures, analyzing logs, and discovering related issues or tickets. This API wraps around the chatbot logic, performing tasks such as:

- Generating answers using a Large Language Model (LLM).
- Searching for relevant context in a vector database based on user queries.
- Handling adjustable parameters for generative models (model name, temperature, max tokens) and embeddings.

## Swagger UI

The Swagger interface (available at `https://myserver.com/docs`) can be used to discover the API endpoints and also try them.

## Endpoints

### `POST /prompt`

#### Description

Processes a single user message along with various model and search parameters, then returns a generated response along with any relevant resource URLs.

#### Request Body

JSON object matching the schema:

| Field                   | Type    | Constraints                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `content`               | string  | Required                                                        | The user’s message or prompt content.                                                                                                                       |
| `similarity_threshold`  | float   | Default: `config.search_similarity_threshold` Range: (0, 1]     | Filter for relevant documents by cosine similarity. A higher threshold yields fewer but more precise documents, while a lower threshold is more inclusive.  |
| `temperature`           | float   | Default: `config.default_temperature` Range: [0.1, 1.0]         | Controls the variability in generated responses. A value closer to 1.0 produces more creative/flexible answers; near 0.1 yields more deterministic results. |
| `max_tokens`            | int     | Default: `config.default_max_tokens` Range: [1, 1024]           | Limits the maximum length of the generated response.                                                                                                        |
| `profile_name`          | string  | Default: `constants.CI_LOGS_PROFILE`                            | The name of the profile to use.                                                                                                                             |
| `generative_model_name` | string  | Default: `config.generative_model`                              | The name of the LLM to be used for response generation.                                                                                                     |
| `embeddings_model_name` | string  | Default: `config.embeddings_model`                              | The name of the embeddings model used for vector-based document similarity.                                                                                 |
